## What You Need to Do to Get Going and Make Your First HTML Page
1. **Set Up a Text Editor**: Use a text editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++.
2. **Create a New File**: Save the file with a `.html` extension, e.g., `index.html`.
3. **Basic Structure**:
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>My First HTML Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
4. **Open in a Browser**: Open the HTML file in a web browser to see your first web page.

## What are HTML Tags and Attributes
- **HTML Tags**: Tags are the building blocks of HTML. They define the structure and content of the web page.
    - Example: `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`
- **HTML Attributes**: Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always included in the opening tag.
    - Example: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">`

### HTML Tag vs Element
- **HTML Tag**: The syntax used to define elements in an HTML document.
    - Example: `<h1>` and `</h1>` are tags.
- **HTML Element**: The combination of a start tag, its content, and an end tag.
    - Example: `<h1>Title</h1>` is an element.

### HTML Attributes
- **Definition**: Attributes are used to provide additional information about an element.
- **Format**: Written within the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs.
    - Example: `<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>`

This overview of HTML introduces you to the basic concepts and provides a foundation for creating and understanding web pages.
