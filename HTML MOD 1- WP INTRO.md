# HTML Module 1: Web Programming Introduction

## Architecture of a Website
- **Client-Server Model**: Websites operate on a client-server model where the client (browser) requests resources, and the server responds with the requested resources.
- **Front-End vs. Back-End**:
  - **Front-End**: The part of the website that users interact with directly (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
  - **Back-End**: The server-side of a website, handling database interactions, user authentication, and business logic (server-side languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Node.js).
- **Database**: Stores data used by the website. Common databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
- **Hosting**: The service that makes your website accessible on the internet. Hosting providers include AWS, Heroku, and DigitalOcean.

## Different Technologies in Making a Website
- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: The standard markup language for creating web pages. It structures content on the web.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual styling.
- **JavaScript**: A programming language that enables interactive web pages. It allows for dynamic content updates, form validation, and multimedia control.
- **Web Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - **Front-End Frameworks/Libraries**: React, Angular, Vue.js.
  - **Back-End Frameworks**: Django, Ruby on Rails, Express.js.
- **Version Control Systems**: Git is the most common version control system, allowing developers to track changes and collaborate on projects.
- **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**: Allow different software systems to communicate with each other. REST and GraphQL are common API architectures.

## Web Development Introduction
- **Planning**: Define the purpose, target audience, and goals of the website. Create wireframes and prototypes.
- **Development**:
  - **Setting up the Environment**: Install necessary software and tools (text editor, version control, browser).
  - **Writing Code**: Develop the front-end and back-end components of the website.
- **Testing**: Check for bugs and ensure the website works as expected across different browsers and devices.
- **Deployment**: Upload the website to a hosting server and make it live.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly update content, fix bugs, and improve features.

This introduction to web programming sets the foundation for building a robust and efficient website.
